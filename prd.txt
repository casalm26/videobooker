PRD: VideoBooker – Automated Video Marketing + Bookings for Local Businesses

1) Summary
- Problem: Local SMBs know video works but lack time, skills, and integrated tools to create promos and turn interest into booked appointments.
- Solution: One platform that turns business info into weekly, platform-optimized promo videos and converts viewers to appointments via integrated booking and DM assistants.
- Target: Independent service providers and retail shops (salons, fitness, dental, auto, home services, restaurants).
- Differentiator: Integrated stack (AI video + posting formats + DM-to-appointment + analytics) at SMB-friendly price.

2) Goals and Success Metrics
- Primary goals
  - Reduce time-to-first-promo to under 30 minutes from sign-up.
  - Drive measurable bookings from social content.
- North-star metric: Appointments booked per active business per month.
- KPIs
  - Onboarding completion rate: ≥70% within 24 hours of signup.
  - Time-to-first-video: ≤15 minutes median.
  - Video-to-appointment conversion rate: ≥1.5% in first 90 days; target 3% by month 6 (view → click/DM → booked).
