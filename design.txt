Below is a concise, end-to-end frontend design proposal tailored to the PRD, focused on getting users to their first published promo and first booked appointment fast.

Product principles for UI
- Speed to value: Everything pushes toward “Publish first video + get first booking” within 30 minutes.
- Guardrails over freedom: Template-first, opinionated defaults, safe areas, and auto-formats.
- One connected flow: Creation → Posting → DM-to-Booking → Analytics, with clear handoffs.
- Quiet power: Advanced options tucked away; starter path is a straight line.

Information architecture
Primary navigation (left rail)
- Home (Dashboard)
- Create (Video)
- Schedule
- Inbox (DM)
- Bookings
- Analytics
- Library (Brand Kit, Templates, Media)
- Settings (Business, Integrations, Billing, Team)

Global elements
- Top bar: Business switcher, plan/usage, help, notifications, profile.
- Persistent “30-Minute Launch” checklist banner until first publish + booking.

First-run and onboarding
Goal: Under 10 minutes to complete; under 15 minutes to first draft videos.

1) Welcome screen
- A/B: “Guided 30-minute Launch” vs “Explore first” (default guided).
- Progress bar with milestones: Profile → Social → Booking → Brand → Offers → Generate.

2) Step 1: Business profile (2 minutes)
- Fields: category, services (top 3), hours, location.
- “Smart defaults” via category presets. Inline examples.

3) Step 2: Connect social (2 minutes)
- Meta connect card for FB/IG (primary in MVP). Clear benefits list.
- State: Connected, Needs permission, Retry. Test publish sandbox toggle.

4) Step 3: Booking integration (3 minutes)
- Calendly/Acuity OAuth cards. Live availability preview panel.
- Services mapping: “Haircut (service) → 45 min (Calendly event type)”.
- Confirmation and reminder defaults applied with editable copy.
- Test button: “Open booking link” to verify flow (in modal).

5) Step 4: Brand kit (2 minutes)
- Upload logo, pick colors, select font pairing.
- Brand color auto-preview on video frames. Accessibility contrast meter.

6) Step 5: Offers and CTAs (1 minute)
- Choose one kick-off offer template per vertical. Example copy prefilled.
- CTA defaults: Book now → Booking link. Optional deposit link input.

7) Step 6: Generate first set
- “Generate 3 video concepts” button with render progress steps (Script → Scenes → VO/Music → Render).
- Skeleton previews. Drafts in ≤3 minutes target.
- If provider issues: automatic fallback with notice but no action required.

Post-onboarding success screen
- Carousel of 3 drafts with “Pick 1 to refine” primary action.
- Secondary: “Schedule all 3 for this month”.

Create: video generation and light editor
Template gallery
- By industry tiles (12+ verticals). Each shows runtime, tone, typical hooks.
- “Quick Start” surface: “Best pick for your vertical today” with seasonal hook.

Concept screen
- Left: Variation selector (1–3). Click to swap.
- Center: Live preview with platform frame overlays (safe text regions).
- Right: Controls (only the essentials):
  - Copy buckets: Hook, Body, Offer, CTA. Toggle A/B copy per bucket.
  - Brand lock: Colors, logo position presets, caption style.
  - Format: 9:16 primary; auto-derive 1:1 and 16:9.
  - Subtitles: On by default; style presets; language; VO voice select.
  - Music selector: Auto; swap with 3 curated options; loudness normalization on.
- Compliance: AI voiceover disclosure toggle and preview placement.

CTA end-card micro-builder

- Booking link auto-insert; customizable short link; UTM preset builder.
- Test link opens booking modal preview with real availability.

Render queue UI
