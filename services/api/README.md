# API Service

Express + TypeScript backend for VideoBooker. The service currently ships with an in-memory
store and mocked workflows so the web client can iterate on flows before persistence and
external integrations are wired up.

### Storage plan

The mock data layer returns asset URLs that mimic a CDN, but no binary uploads are stored by
the service yet. When persistence lands we will back video renders and other large media with
an object store such as Amazon S3 fronted by a CDN, and wire the API to hand out signed URLs
for uploads and downloads. Until then, any `assetUrl` or thumbnail paths you see in responses
are just fixtures from the in-memory store to help the client build its flows.

## Development

```bash
npm install
npm run dev:api
```

The server boots on port `4000` by default. All routes expect and respond with JSON.

## Route reference

The mocked API surface is organised by feature slice. Each path below is mounted relative to
the service root (e.g. `GET /health`). Request bodies and params are validated with Zod â€“ the
schemas live alongside their routers under `src/modules/**`.
